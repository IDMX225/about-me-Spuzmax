            <h2>Biography:</h2>

            <div>
                <p>I started out posessing excessive knowledge...</p>

                <p>First, I knew I wanted to be an Astronaut. Then I knew I wanted to be an Air Force pilot. I knew I wanted to be a lawyer. I knew I wanted to be an actor. I knew I wanted to be a stuntman... You get the idea.</p>

                <p>All the unnecessary knowledge faded away in 1981 when my Father brought home an Apple ][+ computer and the certain knowledge that my future would revolve around computing arrived. When I graduated High School in 1984, I was already a computer professional. I worked for a local Apple dealer, the same one where my Father bought the Apple ][+. When my Father asked me if I was going to go to college, I replied "If I go to college now, I will waste my time and your money." I knew at that time computer education in colleges was based on mainframe computers, time-sharing access and punch cards. No one was teaching about PCs and where they could go.</p>
                
                <p>Over the next few years I obtained industry training and certifications in PC hardware, software and networking (in the time before consumer internet access was widely available). In the mid-90s I obtained a position at a certain telephone company working in their research labs, certifying, testing, deploying and supporting networking hardware and software for a nationwide internet backbone. I have since worked for several national auto parts companies, where my love of cars is very helpful. I find I am interested in moving back into the IT industry, however, not having a college degree is greatly hampering my efforts. Hence, my attending RVCC to obtain an associates degree in IT.<p>
                
                <p>In my time as a hobbyist and working with personal computers, I have worked on over 40 different microprocessor platforms, over 45 different operating systems, and I have programmed in 17 programming languages.</p>

                <p>In my life I have walked on five continents: North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. I have seen the beauty of dawn over the Atlantic and the setting of the sun over the Pacific. I have experienced the streets of Jerusalem, where people have walked for over 3,000 years. I have swum with sharks, played with dolphins, marveled at sea turtles, explored ship wrecks and taken beautiful pictures of sea life. I have yet to score a hole-in-one at golf, but I'm still trying! I witnessed and experienced the heartbreak and the anguish of 9/11. I have been part of a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' stage cast. I have cradled my new-born sons in my hands and been in awe at the mystery of life.</p>

                <p>And now, I am a 59 year old Freshman in college!!</p>
