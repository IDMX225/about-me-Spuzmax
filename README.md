# Description

I created this website as part of my Web Page Development Class at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg, NJ. 

Each week we added features to explore techniques and features of HTML5 and CSS based web development. Including:
- Installing and configuring a development environment using VS Code, GitHub and hosting content on netlify.app
- Using Dev Tools inspector to disect what is actually happening when the web page is being displayed
- Formating, editing and adding images properly to a web page with considerations for resolution and size
- Using GitHub for version control during development of a website
- Including Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to separate the content of the website from the style and presentation characteristics of the website
- Understanding accessibility issues that can occur in websites
- Box model styling for control over borders, margins, padding, and other visual elements of a website
- Mobile First styling using mediat states for a responsive design based on a variety of client display resolutions
- Implementing Flex and Grid, which go beyond the Box model, for greater control of placement and interactivity of elements of a website
- Embedding media into a website for video and audio presentation
- Using CodePen as a source for programming and visual elements 
- Tables for presenting structured information on a website
- Forms for collecting information from a client of a website
- Navigation options for client control of the website, for mobile and desktop use
